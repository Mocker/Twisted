MAP EDITOR DONE (For the most part):

TO DO:
COLLISION CHECKING (ugh ugh)
Modify enemies - collisions, ai.. more types and animations.
Sprites - maybe some giant skyish background image
Levels - add an 'end object' that can define where the player needs to get to to beat the level
objects - more interaction.. animations? Destructible?
Code actions for main character - block, out of breath etc
GUI - .. lives, time, score.. vertigo? 
CREATE FUN PLAY LEVELS
Save game function?
Use astors building tiles to create a set of maps in a level
Create 'bullet' class. Players suitcase for player.. maybe robo bullets or lazers or something for robots
	-- time_to_live, animation set, (damage?), x, y, dx, dy
add enemies to level xml file? start x, starty, type, time_entered or maybe wave#(if all existing enemies are dead, add next wave..)


** add sound effects class
** add background_music class
record some sound effects and background music

*Right now the editor cannot create multiple maps on the same level file. To do this we'll need to create multiple level files, then copy & paste the "<map .. /map>" part


Running out of time :(

22:41 < As> But he's actually going to be walking on the building tops, jumping from building to building, being chased by robots.
22:41 < An> what are you serious?
22:41 < As> He's just an ordinary business guy except for one thing...
22:41 < An> (you keep saying my name)
22:41 < kevin> ...he's super bouncy?
22:41 < As> He has vertigo!
22:41 < mocker> that's a sexy screenshot
22:41 < As> His vertigo gives him super powers.
22:42 < As> When he gets closer to the edge of a long drop, and depending on the drop height, he gets more wobbly.  Too close, he will fall off the building completely, but just right, he has the power to jump like a super bouncy!
22:42 < As> But I need to get to work now.
22:42 < As> So peace for shizzles.
22:43 < As> (PS:  Pyweek is a one week proggy contest.)
22:43 < An> okay funtimes
22:43 < As> Also, he can throw his briefcase.
22:43 < As> And use it to block shit.
22:44 < mocker> just like any businessman realy
22:44 < mocker> I think this will have mass apeal because people can relate
22:44 < As> 'Course, who hasn't been chased by robots.
